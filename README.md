# TerraNeoSlop - A Terra fork made to work in NeoForge through the magic of AI vibe coding. 

This is a shoddy AI slop generated fork of Terra to get it working in NeoForge, hence the name. 

## Building and Running Terra

To build, simply run `./gradlew build` (`gradlew.bat build` on Windows). This
will build only the NeoForge platform. The other platforms have been disabled.
